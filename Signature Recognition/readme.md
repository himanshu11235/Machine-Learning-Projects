This is the second assignment when I did internship under SOAi as Data Science intern. 
Problem Statement: Given a photo of real signature of a person, and another photo of a signature(real/fake) of same person, use ML to classify the second image as real or fake signature.
Used RNN/CNN to solve the problem. After many attempts and improvements, develpoed the final neural network model for signature recognition.
