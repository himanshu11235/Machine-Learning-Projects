This project is done as third assignment for my internship at SOAi as Data scientist.
Problem Statement: Use deep learning to design a model to recognise hand gestures in real time camera feed and based on that control the VLC media player(play,pause,stop,close,volume up/down, etc).
I used CNN based model to classify gesture and pyvlc library to control the vlc media player.
