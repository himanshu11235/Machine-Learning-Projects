Problem statement: Given a video clip of N number of objects(balls) moving in an environment under the influence of mutual forces. Different pairs may have different forces(like garvitational, spring, electrostatic). The forces are short distance forces. We need to classify diferent object-pairs based on the nature of forces between them in unsupervised fashion, just by looking on the video clip.

Built many different Deep Learning architectures, and tried different training techniques, and after lot of experimentation, came up with an architecture and training methodology which can solve the above problem statement.
