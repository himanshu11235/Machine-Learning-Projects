We use pybox2d physics engine library, to simulate different objects(balls here) moving under physical forces, having different physical properties like collision coefficient, visible/invisible to other objects, etc. 
2-D collision.py is used to generate the trajectory data of objects as numpy array.
Simulator.py is used to take a numpy array of positions and display the motion of objects.
